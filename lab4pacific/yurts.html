            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet 
                off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas 
                walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
        
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down 
                quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience 
                includes electiricity and a sink with hot and cold running 
                water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in 
                the lodge.
            </dd>
        
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and 
                plan to dress for changing weather with light 
                layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a 
                flashlight and a sense of adventure!
